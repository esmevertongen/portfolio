It wasn't something I had to make for grades, but I just followed a workshop RISO printing and we were totally free to make whatever we wanted to make. I really like travelling, so I wanted to make something that included that subject. I made a 'fanzine' which is kind of like a small book and I put every national fruit with the country that I visited. The work that I am showing right now is the digital version, which I also really like, but the physical version is even better, because with RISO printing, the colours come out really pretty.
